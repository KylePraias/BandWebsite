            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Sum 41, formed in 1996 in Ajax, Ontario, Canada, quickly rose to prominence with their distinctive fusion of punk 
                rock and heavy metal. The original lineup featured lead vocalist and guitarist Deryck Whibley, drummer Steve 
                Jocz, guitarist Dave Baksh, and bassist Jason McCaslin. Their energetic performances and genre-blending sound 
                garnered a dedicated fanbase in the early 2000s. The band's debut album, All Killer No Filler (2001), achieved 
                international success, propelled by the hit single "Fat Lip," which topped the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks 
                chart. This success was followed by albums like Does This Look Infected? (2002) and Chuck (2004), showcasing 
                their ability to blend catchy melodies with heavier riffs. Over the years, Sum 41 continued to evolve, 
                experimenting with different styles while maintaining their core punk ethos. Throughout their career, Sum 41 
                faced various challenges, including lineup changes and health issues. Despite these obstacles, they released 
                several more albums, such as Underclass Hero (2007), Screaming Bloody Murder (2011), and 13 Voices (2016), each 
                reflecting their growth as musicians and individuals. Their relentless touring schedule and dynamic live shows 
                solidified their reputation as a formidable force in the rock scene. In 2024, Sum 41 announced that their eighth 
                studio album, Heaven :x: Hell, would be their final release, marking the end of an era for the band and their 
                fans. The double album encapsulates the duality of their musical journey, combining elements of their signature 
                punk sound with heavier metal influences.</p>
